      <h2 class="paragraph-heading">What is a class and what is an id?</h2>
      <p class="paragraph-body">
          When building a website with html and CSS, you have a myriad of ways to create the content and style the content. There's a symbiotic<id><a href="https://www.w3.org/standards/webdesign/htmlcss#:~:text=CSS%20is%20independent%20of%20HTML,or%3A%20content)%20from%20presentation."> relationship between Html and CSS</a>
      </p>
      <p class="paragraph-body">
        Classes and ID’s are CSS attributes you can use to add styling to your webpage. While they perform very similar functions, there are specific scenarios when you should be using a class and vice versa for an ID. 
      </p></div>

    <div> 
      <h2 class="paragraph-heading">What is a class?</h2>
          
      <p class="paragraph-body">
          The class attribute can be used to style many elements. You can create a class which essentially gives styling instructions to each element that uses the class.
      </p>
      
      <p class="paragraph-body">
          To create a class in CSS, you use a "." before the name of the class. As an example, .header is creating a class named "header".
      </p></div>
    
    <div>
      <h2 class="paragraph-heading">What is an ID?</h2>
      <p class="paragraph-body">
          While Classes can be used to style a Class of elements, id’s are unique and can only be used to style one element. While classes can be used for to style many (unlimited) elements on a in html, only one id can be used per id in the html file
      </p>
      <p class="paragraph-body">
          To create a id in CSS, you use a "#" before the name of the id. As an example, #header is creating an id named "header". This id can only be used for one element.
      </p></div>
    

      <!-- Analogy -->
    <div>
      <h2 class="paragraph-heading">Analogy</h2>
      <p class="paragraph-body">
            As a former bank teller, an analogy I’ll use for Classes and ID’s are bank account numbers.

      <p class="img-caption">Bank prefixes and branch ranges in NZ. Sourced from <a
          href="https://www.moneyhub.co.nz/nz-bank-codes.html">Moneyhub</a></p>

      <p class="paragraph-body">
            In New Zealand we have 4 sections for our bank account numbers:
      </p>
      <p class="paragraph-body">
            Bank Prefix - Branch - Account number - Account Suffix.
      </p>  
        
      <p class="paragraph-body">
            As an example:
            02-0100-0123456-00
      </p>  
      </div>

    <div>
      <h2 class="paragraph-heading">Classes:</h2>
      <p class="paragraph-body">
            02 represents the bank - BNZ
      </p>
      <p class="paragraph-body">
            0100 represents the branch - Queen Street, Auckland
      </p>
      </div>

    <div>
      <h2 class="paragraph-heading">ID:</h2>
      <p class="paragraph-body">
            0123456 is the customer number which is unique to each customer. No two customers will have the same customer number.
      </p>
      <p class="paragraph-body">
            For example, anybody that set up their bank account at the BNZ Queen Street branch will have the bank-branch 02-0100 but only one customer will have the 02-0100-0123456.
      </p>
      <p class="paragraph-body">
            Side-note: The last class is the Account Suffix -00 which, dependent on the bank, often represents the account type (i.e. 00 is often an everyday account, 66 is often for a savings account).

      <h2 class="paragraph-heading">Conclusion</h2>
      <p class="paragraph-body">
            As we’ve already learned, a website is made up of these 3 elements: HTML, CSS, and Javascript. These 3 languages works together to make things happen. Without CSS, the HTML just looks like a word document, and without Javascript, the HTML and CSS will just look like a prettied up brochure with no interactivity.

            The Document Object Model (DOM) is the entire data representation of the objects that comprise the structure and content of a document on the web. According to freeCodeCamp, “It is a programming interface that allows us to create, change, or remove elements from the document. We can also add events to these elements to make our page more dynamic. The DOM views an HTML document as a tree of nodes. A node represents an HTML element.” In short, the DOM is the glue that brings HTML, CSS, and Javascript together. The (DOM) is a way that we can change the HTML with Javascript.
