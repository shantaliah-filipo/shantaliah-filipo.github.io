      <h2 class="paragraph-heading">Confidence level using each of the following techniques:</h2>
      <h3 class="paragraph-subheading">Pseudocode: 6/10</h3>
      <p class="paragraph-body">
        I see the the value in pseudocoding. I'm just not great at it at this stage as I struggle to break big technical problems down into smaller, easy-to-understand problems. We'll get there. 
      </p>

      <h3 class="paragraph-subheading">Trying something: 7/10</h3>
      <p class="paragraph-body">
        This one is always the starting point. If I continue getting an error, that's when I move on to another problem-solving technique.
      </p>

      <h3 class="paragraph-subheading">Rubber ducky method: 0/10</h3>
      <p class="paragraph-body">
        I haven't given this one a go as yet, but I definitely think it'd be beneficial to help me explain things in laymans terms so that I actually understand the problem(s) properly. 
      </p>

      <h3 class="paragraph-subheading">Reading error messages: 5/10</h3>
      <p class="paragraph-body">
        This one's two-fold I reckon. I can read error messages and have an idea of what's being suggested for how to fix the issue. Applying this is another story.
      </p>

      <h3 class="paragraph-subheading">Console.logging: 6.5/10</h3>
      <p class="paragraph-body">
        I've console.logged more this sprint than the past 3 sprints combined. I'd like to get into the habit of doing this more, but also understanding the reason for what and why I'm console.logging at a point, and then using the result to troubleshoot from there. 
      </p>

      <h3 class="paragraph-subheading">Googling: 7.5/10</h3>
      <p class="paragraph-body">
        I feel like this one's two-fold. We'll often get an indication of the problem from the given error message, or even through the hints in the Kata's and go from there. Googling is the easy part. It's filtering the results and then translating the syntax info from the website you've found into the problem that you're trying to solve yourself. 
      </p>

      <h3 class="paragraph-subheading">Asking your peers for help: 6/10</h3>
      <p class="paragraph-body">
        My confidence in asking for help waivers. I definitely see the value in it. Sometimes I find it hard to explain the problem I'm having (thank the lawd for screenshots). I think I hold back sometimes from asking questions as I think I should be able to solve the problem through troubleshooting myself. 
      </p>

      <h3 class="paragraph-subheading">Asking coaches for help: 7/10</h3>
      <p class="paragraph-body">
        I haven't asked my facilitator for much help in Foundations, but when I have it's been super useful! 
      </p>

      <h3 class="paragraph-subheading">Improving your process with reflection: 7/10</h3>
      <p class="paragraph-body">
        I think I need to allow/allocate myself more time for reflection. When I do reflect, it's super helpful but I could be doing this more often to assist with growing my muscle-memory.
