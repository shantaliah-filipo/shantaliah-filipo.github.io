        <title>My Learning Plan</title>
    </head>
    <body>
      <h2 class="h2">What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h2>
        <p>My long-term goal is to get into software development. I currently work for a tech company, but my role is customer-service based which is quite limited for future opportunities.
        I’d like to gain transferable skills to hopefully move into a developer, product, or analyst role either in this company or in another company. I’ve got my foot-in-the-door, I’d just like to gain some dev skills so that I can apply for an internship/junior dev role and go from there.</p>

        <p class="h3">A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning</p>
        One of my biggest limitations is that I hold myself back from moving on to the ‘next’ topic/section until I’ve learned everything about the current topic. This has really held me back in Sprint 2 alone. And I still don’t think I understand what I’ve done this week. This has meant that timeboxing has absolutely gone out the window. 
        Another limitation is that I sometimes forget to break big tasks into smaller tasks so that I can focus on one task, complete this, and then move forward. I’m aware that I do this, but need to be more mindful of it. 
       A strength is that I can Google well to try and troubleshoot issues?

        <p class="h3">What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</p>
        I’d like to become better at explaining concepts in simple terms - not only to benefit my Dev Academy journey, but this is beneficial for life in general. 
        I’d also like to become better at asking for help when I need it. This is applicable to my Dev Academy journey and life in general. 

        <p class="h3">A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme.</p>
        I’ve already tried to plan my days since Sprint 1 but I do need to do this more effectively. I’m still working part-time (planned on working through Foundations and then stopping for bootcamp) and this has been a contributing factor to my struggles this week. I tried to learn/go through the most heavy content sections on my days off at the start of the week but this didn’t align with my end goal to have completed most of my learning and blog content by Thursday/Friday. 
        My workplace is flexible so I’ll be requesting to work less for the next 3 weeks. 

        This will free up more time between Monday-Friday for me to go through and effectively consume/practice the learning materials. If I find myself getting stuck, I’ll be able to reach out on Discord while facilitators are there to help me get unstuck - if my fellow students aren’t able to do this. 

        Freeing up time during the weekdays will give me more time to purely focus on the Dev Academy learning material, and practice. 

        For Sprint 3-onwards, I’ll need to be planning my days more effectively and be using a Pomodoro timer so that I’m not spending hours at a time trying to write code without breaks. 

        <p class="h3">A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</p>
        Firstly, I’d like to get a bit more feedback about my commit messages as I know that they’re most likely weak. 

        Also, I know Foundations is self-paced but I think I would find it beneficial if there was a drop-in time with facilitators. Or if we’re already able to book in a quick one-on-one with our facilitator then disregard. 

        The main reason why I mention the above is because seeing people posting their blogs so early in the week while I was struggling with the content made me feel discouraged (it’s a me problem, I know).
