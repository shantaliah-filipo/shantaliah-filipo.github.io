      <h2 class="paragraph-heading"></h2>
      <h3 class="paragraph-subheading"></h3>
      <p class="paragraph-body">
      </p>

      <h2 class="paragraph-heading">Foundations: What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h2>

      <p class="paragraph-body">
        My long-term goal is to get into software development. I currently work for a tech company, but my role is customer-service based which is quite limited for future opportunities.
      </p>
      <p class="paragraph-body">
        I’d like to gain transferable skills to hopefully move into a developer, product, or analyst role either in this company or in another company. 
        I’ve got my foot-in-the-door, I’d just like to gain some dev skills so that I can apply for an internship/junior dev role and go from there.
      </p>

      <h2 class="paragraph-heading">Bootcamp: Anything to add?</h2>

      <p class="paragraph-body">
        To follow on from my aspirations outlined in the foundations learning plan below, I’d like to find a better
        balance between the core and technical skills which I can carry with me in my future careers prospects.
      </p>
      </div>

      <div>
      <h2 class="paragraph-heading">Foundations: A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning</h2>

      <p class="paragraph-body">
        One of my biggest limitations is that I hold myself back from moving on to the ‘next’ topic/section until I’ve learned everything about the current topic. 
        This has really held me back in Sprint 2 alone. And I still don’t think I understand what I’ve done this week. 
        This has meant that timeboxing has absolutely gone out the window. 
      </p>
      <p class="paragraph-body">
        Another limitation is that I sometimes forget to break big tasks into smaller tasks so that I can focus on one task, complete this, and then move forward. I’m aware that I do this, but need to be more mindful of it. 
      </p>
      <p class="paragraph-body">
       A strength is that I can Google well to try and troubleshoot issues?
      </p>

      <h2 class="paragraph-heading">Bootcamp: Anything to add?</h2>
      <p class="paragraph-body">
        A strength would be that I’ve slowly grown more comfortable asking for help to help me get unstuck. This is a
        bit of a double-edged sword because it’s also a big limitation of mine, but I’m working on it.
      </p>
      </div>

      <div>
      <h2 class="paragraph-heading">Foundations: What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h2>
      <p class="paragraph-body">
        I’d like to become better at explaining concepts in simple terms - not only to benefit my Dev Academy journey, but this is beneficial for life in general. Working in groups and pairs will help me work on this, as well as allowing me to become more self-aware.
        I’d also like to become better at asking for help when I need it. This is applicable to my Dev Academy journey and life in general. 
        </p>
      <h2 class="paragraph-heading">Bootcamp: Anything to add?</h2>
      <p class="paragraph-body">
        I think the biggest challenge would be staying on top of the material. Keeping in mind that I don’t have to know
        every single thing about topic/method/activity to give it a go. I intend to plan more before starting an
        activity instead of jumping straight in.
        It also goes without saying, but taking care of ourselves throughout these 9 weeks will also be crucial to
        make it through the entire bootcamp without burning out. Self-reflection and reaching out to facilitators (core and tech) when I need help are key to making sure things don't become too intense to handle for me. 
      </p>
      </div>

      <div>
      <h2 class="paragraph-heading">Foundations: What's a commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme.</h2>
      <p class="paragraph-body">
        I’ve already tried to plan my days since Sprint 1 but I do need to do this more effectively. I’m still working part-time (planned on working through Foundations and then stopping for bootcamp) and this has been a contributing factor to my struggles this week. 
      </p>

      <p class="paragraph-body"> 
        I tried to learn/go through the most heavy content sections on my days off at the start of the week but this didn’t align with my end goal to have completed most of my learning and blog content by Thursday/Friday. 
        My workplace is flexible so I’ll be requesting to work less for the next 3 weeks. 
      </p>
      <p class="paragraph-body">
        This will free up more time between Monday-Friday for me to go through and effectively consume/practice the learning materials. If I find myself getting stuck, I’ll be able to reach out on Discord while facilitators are there to help me get unstuck - if my fellow students aren’t able to do this. 
      </p>
      <p class="paragraph-body">
        Freeing up time during the weekdays will give me more time to purely focus on the Dev Academy learning material, and practice. 
        For Sprint 3-onwards, I’ll need to be planning my days more effectively and be using a Pomodoro timer so that I’m not spending hours at a time trying to write code without breaks. 
      </p>

      <h2 class="paragraph-heading">Bootcamp: Anything to add?</h2>
      <p class="paragraph-body">
        As I won't be working during bootcamp, this takes a massive load off of my shoulders. 
        I'll need to commit more of an effort to taking micro-breaks as well as extended breaks to give my brain a rest. This will need to include taking time for myself to do small things that take me away from the computers.
      </p>
      </div>

      <div>
      <h2 class="paragraph-heading">A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</h2>
      
      <p class="paragraph-body">
        Firstly, I’d like to get a bit more feedback about my commit messages as I know that they’re most likely weak. 
         Also, I know Foundations is self-paced but I think I would find it beneficial if there was a drop-in time with facilitators. Or if we’re already able to book in a quick one-on-one with our facilitator then disregard.
      </p>
      <p class="paragraph-body">
        The main reason why I mention the above is because seeing people posting their blogs so early in the week while I was struggling with the content made me feel discouraged (it’s a me problem, I know). 
      </p>
      <h2 class="paragraph-heading">Bootcamp: Anything to add?</h2>
      <p class="paragraph-body">
        Have actually received the above during foundations when I've reached out. I can't think of anything further. 
      </p>

    <h2 class="paragraph-heading">Bootcamp: Anything to add?</h2>
    <p class="paragraph-body">
      A couple of things to preface my workload management for bootcamp compared to foundations. Firstly I won’t be
      working, so won’t have the anxiety of not having enough coursework completed before/during starting my work
      week.
      I should be able to plan my days and weeks better so that I can solely focus on bootcamp.
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph-body">
      Secondly, I’ve learned through foundations how important reflection or revision is when learning all of these
      new
      technical concepts. This is something that I intend to incorporate into my daily routine (even if it’s just
      10-15
      minutes at the start or end of each day).
    </p>
      </div>

      <div>
      <h2 class="paragraph-heading">In conclusion:</h2>

      <p class="paragraph-body">
        Looking at my learning plan, creating and implementing a growth mindset is something that I need to incorporate into my life and Dev Academy journey. 
        I’ve learned that having a growth mindset is not just about being open-minded and rewarding effort as outcome/output is also something that needs to be focused on. 
      </p>
      <p class="paragraph-body">
        It’s hard to practice having a growth mindset without being harsh on myself so this is 100% something I need to keep at the forefront.
        I feel proud of myself for completing the Dots and JS cafe challenges. And I have every right to feel proud of myself for completing these. Yet I can’t rest on laurels. 
      </p>
      <p class="paragraph-body">
        I completed these, and upon reflection could or should have dedicated time to go back and practice the areas that I struggled with. 
        I just didn’t find the time to do this. This is something that would be beneficial moving forward with foundations and bootcamp.
        Even if it’s just an end of day short reflection or going over stretch material, this would be better than no reflection at all. 
      </p>
