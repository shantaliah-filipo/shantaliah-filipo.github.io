      <h3 class="paragraph-subheading">What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h3>
      <p class="paragraph-body">
        I think the most surprising thing about the Core learning is just how big of a focus it is for this course. I think it's safe to say that the reflection activities and blogs that we complete each sprint isn't commonplace for many university/polytechnic or even workplace courses. Self-development programs can often be run seperately from the aforementioned type of courses and it's often up to the learner to try and incorporate their reflection content to their study or workplace scenarios.

      <h3 class="paragraph-subheading">What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h3>
      <p class="paragraph-body">
        Probably just to remember or keep at the top-of-mind the core learning when struggling with the Tech learning.

    <div>
      <h2 class="paragraph-heading"></h2>
      <h3 class="paragraph-subheading">Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on
        core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?</h3>
      <p class="paragraph-body">
        Firstly, to prepare us well for the "real-world". I'm paraphrashing but I chatted with my mentor at the Re-Leased campus and he basically said that nobody wants to work with 'pricks'. He emphasised that employers are looking for people who are willing to grow, learn and work in a team. It's not expected for junior developers to know everything and write perfect code. 
      </p>
      <p class="paragraph-body">
        Focusing on the human element and people skills not only sets us up well for new career-paths as programmers, but is also beneficial for our overall well-being and life in general. Becoming a programmers is about giving things a go, making mistakes, knowing how to problem-solve and ask questions. All of these aspects can be hard to adapt to, but seem to be the realities of a programmer.

      <h3 class="paragraph-subheading">Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time?
        Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.</h3>

      <p class="paragraph-body">
        In no way shape or form do I think the time spent studying the core content a waste of time. If anything, I think it should be more common practice in educational and workplace settings.
      </p>
      <p class="paragraph-body">
        As an absolute newb to coding, the core content helped to bring me back to centre when I hit many metaphorical walls and would roast myself for not being able to move forward on a task.
