      <h3 class="paragraph-subheading">What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the
        core learning?</h3>
      <p class="paragraph-body">
        Through core learning, I've learned that my inner-critic is way too loud. 
        I'm an absolute newb to coding and that's something that I constantly that I have to remind myself for when I can't get unstuck or don't understand a concept/question/activity. 
        At these points, I feel like I don't know anything when in reality I've learned a buuuuuunch of things.
      </p>
      <p class="paragraph-body">
        I've also learned about the importance of building habits. 
        As the sprints have progressed, we've learned that continual practice is often the best way for us to progress our learning or understanding of what often feels like gibberish.
        The same goes for emotional or mental check-ins with yourself, especially when going through such an intensive course where new, complex concepts are constantly being introduced.
      </p>
      <p class="paragraph-body">
        Lastly, the listening and looping exercises were really useful as they made me realise that I need to improve my active listening skills and attention-span. 
        I found it hard to difficult not to interject as well as to keep my attention focused on what my buddies were telling me. 
        Actively listening while forcing your mind not to wonder is hard werk.

      <h3 class="paragraph-subheading">What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and
        programming?</h3>
      <p class="paragraph-body">
        <i>
        "Tech employers aren't looking for top grades or the person with the most outstanding code. They're looking for
        exceptional human beings who will enhance the culture of their team." 
        </i> - Some legend at Dev Academy.
      </p>
      <p class="paragraph-body">
        As has been reiterated throughout the application and foundations process(es), something that's been lacking historically in tech training is teaching human skills.
        Human or people skills are fundamental when working or collaborating in teams. 
        Our human skills are influenced by our values as well as our ability to have empathy and self-awareness. It's what differentiates a good candidate or employee from a great one.

      <h3 class="paragraph-subheading">What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h3>
      <p class="paragraph-body">
        I think the most surprising thing about the Core learning is just how big of a focus it is for this course. I think it's safe to say that the reflection activities and blogs that we complete each sprint isn't commonplace for many university/polytechnic or even workplace courses. Self-development programs can often be run seperately from the aforementioned type of courses and it's often up to the learner to try and incorporate their reflection content to their study or workplace scenarios.

      <h3 class="paragraph-subheading">What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h3>
      <p class="paragraph-body">
        Probably just to remember or keep at the top-of-mind the core learning when struggling with the Tech learning.

    <div>
      <h2 class="paragraph-heading"></h2>
      <h3 class="paragraph-subheading">Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on
        core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?</h3>
      <p class="paragraph-body">
        Firstly, to prepare us well for the "real-world". I'm paraphrashing but I chatted with my mentor at the Re-Leased campus and he basically said that nobody wants to work with 'pricks'. He emphasised that employers are looking for people who are willing to grow, learn and work in a team. It's not expected for junior developers to know everything and write perfect code. 
      </p>
      <p class="paragraph-body">
        Focusing on the human element and people skills not only sets us up well for new career-paths as programmers, but is also beneficial for our overall well-being and life in general. Becoming a programmers is about giving things a go, making mistakes, knowing how to problem-solve and ask questions. All of these aspects can be hard to adapt to, but seem to be the realities of a programmer.

      <h2 class="paragraph-heading"></h2>
      <h3 class="paragraph-subheading">Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time?
        Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.</h3>

      <p class="img-caption">Hell naw Smokey</p>
      <p class="paragraph-body">
        No way! In no way shape or form do I think the time spent studying the core content a waste of time. If anything, I think it should be more common practice in educational and workplace settings.
      </p>
      <p class="paragraph-body">
        As an absolute newb to coding, the core content helped to bring me back to centre when I hit many metaphorical walls and would roast myself for not being able to move forward on a task.
