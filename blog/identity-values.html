      <h2>Using the evidence gathered, describe your core personal values.</h2>

      <p>My core personal values are kindness, open-mindedness, and family.</p>

      <h2>Explain a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made, and the consequences of your action.</h2>
        <p2>The most poignant example was in a previous job in a role that I really enjoyed. The company was a not-for-profit and was going through a restructure or sorts. Upon reaching a year at this company, I had received notification about a pay increase. As it was a fairly new company, we were all fairly transparent with pay rates since we started as there were less than 10 people in the company. We also weren’t a performance based company (at least to our knowledge).</p2>
       <p>While I had received this increase, I became aware that other staff hadn’t. With this in mind, I raised this with management to let them know that as I hadn’t been given any info about what criteria I was meeting to receive such increase it didn’t feel right.</p>
        <p>As a big believer in equity, this went against my morals and values big time. While I benefited from this scenario, it genuinely didn’t sit right so I emailed upper level management to ask for a clarity about my situation. I received push-back, and this provided enough clarity for me to look for work elsewhere.</p>
        
        <h2>Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity</h2>
        <p>
        Family is everything. As a Pacific Island woman, family is always at the forefront of any educational or career decisions that one makes. It’s not only to make our family proud and better off for future generations, but to also honour the struggle that our parents and ancestors went through to provide us with better lives by leaving their homes. 
        In saying this, I’ve always struggled with my identity. I’m a proud Samoan, but I can only speak and understand very little of the language and this is something that I’ve always been self-conscious about. </p>
