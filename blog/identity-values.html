<h1 id="main-heading">Identity, Values and Strengths Exploration</h1>

 <div class="flex-container">
   <div>
     <h2 class="paragraph-heading">Using the evidence gathered, describe your core personal values.</h2>
     <p class="paragraph-body">
        My core personal values are kindness, open-mindedness, and family
     </p>
    </div>
     
    <div>
     <h2 class="paragraph-heading">
        Explain a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make. Discuss how you
        weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made, and the consequences of your action
      </h2>     

     <p class="paragraph-body">
      The most poignant example was in a previous job in a role that I really enjoyed. The company was a not-for-profit
      and was going through a restructure or sorts. Upon reaching a year at this company, I had received notification
      about a pay increase. As it was a fairly new company, we were all fairly transparent with pay rates since we
      started as there were less than 10 people in the company. We also weren’t a performance based company (at least to
      our knowledge).
     </p>

    <p class="paragraph-body">
      While I had received this increase, I became aware that other staff hadn’t. With this in mind, I raised this with
      management to let them know that as I hadn’t been given any info about what criteria I was meeting to receive such
      increase it didn’t feel right.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph-body">
      As a big believer in equity, this went against my morals and values big time. While I benefited from this
      scenario, it genuinely didn’t sit right so I emailed upper level management to ask for a clarity about my
      situation. I received push-back, and this provided enough clarity for me to look for work elsewhere.
    </p>

    <div>
    <h2 class="paragraph-heading">
      Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity
    </h2>

    <p class="paragraph-body">
      Family is everything. As a Pacific Island woman, family is always at the forefront of any educational or career
      decisions that one makes. It’s not only to make our family proud and better off for future generations, but to
      also honour the struggle that our parents and ancestors went through to provide us with better lives by leaving
      their homes.
    </p>

    </div>
    <div>
    <h2 class="paragraph-heading"> 
      Evaluate your strengths and limitations in terms of your learning and career development
    </h2>
    <p class="paragraph-body">
      I really do enjoy learning new things - so as much as I may struggle through this course I will enjoy knowing that
      I’m learning new skills
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph-body">
      I’ve also been given the reassurance that there’s always someone willing to help us out if we’re needing a hand with
      something
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph-body">
      I also enjoy helping people. In a previous job, I worked at a call centre which helped the victims of cyber-related
      scams. While I often felt like my advice or reassurance was inadequate compared to the scam that they had
      experienced, they were primarily happy that they had someone who would listen. This is definitely the most
      fulfilling role I’ve had in my professional career. The reason why I bring this up is because in some way, this will
      be useful for my learning journey. Or even if I’m unable to help people, I’ll need to remember this for when I’m
      stuck and need help - don’t be afraid to ask for help because there’s always someone that’s willing and happy to
      lend a hand.
    </p>

    <div>
    <h2 class="paragraph-heading">
      Identify which of your strengths might help you in your learning journey and how they intersect with learning
      obstacles.
    </h2>
    <p class="paragraph-body">
      Feeling inadequate, and not putting myself in uncomfortable situations - i.e. professional
      situations where I won’t feel like I’m skilled enough
      Struggling to move forward with a task if I haven’t completed the current task to a high-perfect standard - meaning
      I waste so much time trying to make it perfect the first time

      Example of where you tried working productively, but there was resistance/tension.

      Work environment where a coworker didn’t mesh with our manager. All I could really do was listen and understand her
      experience as I didn’t have any official capacity to help.
