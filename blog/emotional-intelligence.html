<h2>What is Emotional Intelligence</h2>
<p>
Emotional intelligence (EI) is the ability to understand both our behaviours and emotions, and that of others, and to use this awareness to guide our decision-making.
</p>

<h2>How is Emotional Intelligence different to IQ?</h2>
<p>
This differs from IQ, which is determined by academic abilities, problem-sholving, and academic comprehension. 
</p>

<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
<p>
Emotional intelligence is about evaluating our own emotions, and the ability to empathise with others. It’s pivotal when building connections and trust with people. It’s not just about understand emotions, but utilising this understanding to facilitate thinking when making decisions. (It’s essentially reading-the-room).
</p>
<p>
This is extremely important both in a self-awareness capacity, but also in a team-building environment. If I apply it to the learning environment, it’s about identifying when you’re feeling not 100% and then just “feeling the feeling” with no judgement. 
Also, in group work environments, emotional intelligence will be key to working cohesively. It won’t be about delivering the best product, but to understand each other’s learning style and capabilities, and to keep this front-of -mind if there’s any hitches along the road.
