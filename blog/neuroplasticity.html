      <h2 class="paragraph-heading">How do the benefits of neuroplasticity benefit people? </h2>
      <p class="paragraph-body">
          According to neuroscientists, imagining an action and doing it require the same motor and sensory organs in the brain. 
      </p>
      <p class="paragraph-body">
          Neuroplasticity looks to have major benefits to people who have suffered neuro-related injuries (i.e. stroke survivors, people with brain damage). The premise of neuroplasticity is that the brain is malleable and so repeated, intentional, and uncomfortable efforts are required to experience long-lasting change. Neuroplasticity centres around the capacity for our brain cells to change in response to behaviour. 
      </p>
      <p class="paragraph-body">
          It’s about exercising the brain to build connections which strengthen the more the brain is exercised. 
      </p>
      <p class="paragraph-body">
          The way that the Dev Academy curriculum is structured has already provided some of the components to see neuroplastic change. 
          <br>I think something that I need to commit more to is the “intention” aspect. 
          I’ve noticed that sometimes I’m just going through the course content on autopilot and not engaging effectively with it. 
          This has caused me to struggle later on in a sprint as I had no clue for where to start with solving a problem.

        <h2 class="paragraph-heading">The Growth Mindset</h2>
        <p class="paragraph-body">
          The growth mindset is the belief that people's abilities can be developed through hard-work, perserverance, and dedication. 
          In this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0qpJxEhOP4&ab_channel=HarvardBusinessReview">video</a> by the Hardvard Business Review, they discuss how the Growth Mindset has become a buzzword and the meaning of this has been distored over time. 
        
        <h3 class="paragraph-subheading">Common misconceptions:</h3>  
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph-body">
          People confuse a growth mindset with flexibility, being open-minded, and having a positive outlook. This is a fallacy as a pure growth mindset doesn’t actually exist. We’re a mixture of fixed and growth mindsets 
          <br>
          Another misconception is that growth mindsets are just about praising and reward effort. However outcomes do matter. 
          It’s critical to reward not just effort, but learning and progress, and to emphasise the progress that yield these things such as seeking help from others, trying new strategies, and capitalising on setbacks to move forward effectively. This is a misconception that I had.
          <br>
          The last misconception is that just supporting or adopting a growth mindset will result in good things happening (i.e. not having policies in place that make growth mindset strategies attainable). Good policies support collaboration across organisational boundaries rather than competition between employees. 
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph-body">           
          It can be hard to maintain growth mindsets because we have our own fixed-mindset habits. Challenges, criticism, and comparison to others can push us into defensiveness or insecurities. 
        <p class="paragraph-body">
          For me, something that I’ve struggled with since Sprint 1 of Dev Academy is my own comparison of my work output to others (i.e. people posting their work so early on in the week and I hadn’t even started). This is something that I’m actively working on to stop doing as it’s doing me no good. I’m working on not comparing my blogs to other people’s blogs. 
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph-body">
          I think reflection will need to be more of a go-to centring activity through the rest of my foundations time and bootcamp time. I often feel like I’ve learned nothing and know nothing, but actually looking at what I’ve achieved in previous sprints or even just by the end of one day is really rewarding and something I’ll need to keep in mind to remind me of how much I’ve actually achieved. 
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph-body">
          I also think that I’ll need to identify AND practice areas where I’m lacking. I haven’t given myself time in sprints 2 or 3 to do stretch material for areas that I struggled with (mainly because I haven’t had time to do stretch material).
